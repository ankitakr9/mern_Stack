    <h1>Introduction of Web-Development</h1>
    <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications that run online, encompassing tasks from designing the user interface to writing the code that makes them functional, secure, and efficient. It involves both front-end development, which focuses on what users see and interact with, and back-end development, which handles the server-side logic, databases, and overall application functionality. </p>
     <img src="Server.jpg">
    <h1>Web-Development Process</h1>
    <p>The web development process generally involves discovery/analysis, planning, design, development, testing, launch, and maintenance. In the discovery phase, requirements and goals are defined, leading to a plan and site structure. The design phase focuses on the website's visual appearance and user experience. Development involves coding the frontend and backend, followed by thorough testing to fix bugs and ensure functionality. The site is then launched, becoming publicly accessible. Finally, the maintenance phase involves ongoing updates, security checks, and optimization to keep the website running smoothly.  </p>

    <h1> Networking Concepts</h1>

    <h2>What is Internet?</h1>
    <p>Internet is a global communication system that links together thousands of individual networks. It allows exchange of information between two or more computers on a network. Thus internet helps in transfer of messages through mail, chat, video & audio conference, etc.</p>

    <h1>What is IP Address?</h1>
    <p>Internet is a global communication system that links together thousands of individual networks. It allows exchange of information between two or more computers on a network. Thus internet helps in transfer of messages through mail, chat, video & audio conference, etc.</p>
    
    <h2>How it Works?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Unique Identification: 
            Each device, from computers and smartphones to smart home devices, gets a unique IP address. 
 
</li>
        <li>Location Addressing: 
            The IP address contains location information, which helps route data packets across the network to their final destination.</li>
        <li>The Internet Protocol (IP): 
            IP is a set of rules for how data packets are formatted and sent across networks, and IP addresses are part of this system. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Types of IP Address-</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>IPv4: 
            The first version of the IP address, a 32-bit number, which became too small to support the growing number of internet devices.</li>
        <li>IPv6: 
            The next-generation IP address, using 128 bits, provides a vastly larger address space to accommodate the increasing number of connected devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Access a Website?</h2>
    <p>When you type a website URL (like <b>www.google.com</b>) in the browser, 
       the browser sends a request to a server. The server finds the website’s data and sends it back to your browser.</p>

    <h2>Who Assigns the IP Address?</h2>
    <p>IP addresses are assigned by <b>Internet Service Providers (ISP)</b> and managed globally by <b>IANA</b> (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).</p>

    <h2>What is DNS?</h2>
    <p><b>DNS (Domain Name System)</b> translates human-readable domain names 
       (like google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.190.78).</p>

    <h2>Problems in Data Transfer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Packet loss</li>
        <li>Network congestion</li>
        <li>Latency (delay)</li>
        <li>Security risks (hacking, interception)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>MAC Address</h2>
    <p>A <b>MAC Address</b> is a unique identifier assigned to each device’s network card.</p>
    <p><b>Format:</b> 6 pairs of hexadecimal digits → <code>00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E</code></p>

    <h2>Port Number</h2>
    <p>A <b>port number</b> helps identify specific processes/services on a computer.  
       Example: <code>80</code> (HTTP), <code>443</code> (HTTPS).</p>
    <p><b>Format:</b> Integer value from <code>0 – 65535</code></p>

    <h2>Local Area Network (LAN)</h2>
    <p>A <b>LAN</b> connects computers within a limited area like a home, school, or office.</p>

    <h2>Switch & Router</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Switch:</b> Connects devices in a LAN and forwards data within the network.</li>
        <li><b>Router:</b> Connects different networks (e.g., home network to the internet).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Public and Private IP Address</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Private:</b> Used inside local networks (e.g., <code>192.168.0.1</code>)</li>
        <li><b>Public:</b> Unique IP visible on the internet, assigned by ISP</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Modern Routers</h2>
    <p>Modern routers combine the features of a <b>router, switch, firewall, and Wi-Fi access point</b> in a single device.</p>

    <h2>What is a VPN?</h2>
    <p>A <b>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</b> creates a secure, encrypted connection 
       between your device and the internet, hiding your IP and ensuring privacy.</p>
